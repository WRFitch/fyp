# Will Fitch Final Year Project

This is a repository for my final year project at Brunel University London, to be focused on Machine Learning and, preferably, stopping climate change (or stopping some other equally terrible thing, such as Godzilla, or another season of Game of Thrones).

## TODO 
- Come up with some decent ideas that are: 
  - feasible
  - productive towards future goals 
  - interesting enough to impress future employers, and also so I don't lose my mind focusing on this at the expense of all else for six months.
- Source datasets (found in datasets.md) 
- Build a decent ML dev environment containing the necessary tools 
  - Python/R IDE 
  - git 
  - cuda/ML framework setup. 
  - what actually _does_ go into one of these? 
  - Automate easy setup
- use datasets to test ideas quickly and easily.
