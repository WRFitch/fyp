# Will Fitch Final Year Project

This is a repository for my final year project at Brunel University London, to be focused on Machine Learning and, preferably, stopping climate change (or stopping some other equally terrible thing, such as Godzilla, or another season of Game of Thrones).

## TODO 
- Come up with more decent ideas that are feasible, interesting, and preferably provide some use to the human race at large.  
- Source datasets (found in datasets.md) 
- use datasets to test ideas quickly and easily. 
- get used to regular python work
