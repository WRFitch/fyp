# Will Fitch Final Year Project

This is a repository for my final year project at Brunel University London, to be focused on Machine Learning and, preferably, stopping climate change (or stopping some other equally terrible thing, such as Godzilla, or another season of Game of Thrones).

## TODO
- Come up with a title, an aim, and seven objectives. 
- Complete minor analyses of climate-related datasets, and see what conclusions can be drawn from them.
