### LOG
Staring down the barrel of finishing the FYP now. I have approximately 6 weeks to complete implementation and write-up. Looking at the backlog, the most important possible things to do are as follows: 
- Write a first draft of dissertation
  - Enumerate what I need to do to complete this in backlog
  - Get all data in
  - Process data for academic consumption
  - Meet all learning objectives
- Get error rate under 5%
  - Tabular method
  - data augmentation
  - Active learning
- Test tabular method
  - Implement feature extraction
  - Implement a tabular recommender given existing or easily accessible data

## Tuesday 
- Practised presentation
- More background research drafting
- Read up on data augmentations in fastai 
- tested unified csv - for some reason, it's janky as all hell. Not sure what's going on there, might have to leave the bad implementation in there until disso is complete. 
- Spoke to allan re: priorities - I can only add in new features once RMSE is under 5%. Testing is more important.
