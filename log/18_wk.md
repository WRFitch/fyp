# Week 18

## TODO
- Reformat weekly log so week number is at the beginning of the filepath for faster tab-ing 
- Get image regression working 
- export a set of test images
  - My House
  - Brunel 
- Expand test dataset to other regions
  - Countryside somewhere 
  - Places with varying ground types and air qualities. There's probably some trad data science to do here. 
- Draft powerpoint lecture on this FYP. 

## Monday
- Researched image regression 
- Despair
- Exported more of test set

## Tuesday 
- More image regression research. 
- Planned week's work
- Tested dataset as a classifier for whether the network can predict whether the SO2 concentration is under 0.004, and it got an error rate of 8% out of the box! 
  - After further work, this is likely untrue. 
- Thought about extending the feature set 
  - Currently it's likely to just be checking whether the result is green or not. the more green can be seen, the higher the SO2 concentration. A larger, more diverse dataset would provide a much more detailed interpolation of roads, etc.
  - A better interpolation would also include nearby square kilometers, due to atmospheric drift.
- Experimented with different resnet architectures. Too big takes too long to train, too small is useless. 
- Experimented with categorical classification methods but realistically more data, a better drop weight plan (meaning more study) and getting the image net to label the intended outputs correctly is more likely to work more effectively.

## Wednesday
- Optimised import pipeline
- put f-strings in basically everything, because they're lovely. 
- A lot of reading about fastai, theory, and the DataBlock API. 
  - It seems I can't just demand fastai outputs the way I want - I have to give it the right input, let it infer the correct type from that, then get the outputs I want. In other news, heavy python use apparently causes brain damage.
