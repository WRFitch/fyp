# Week 14

- found fast.ai guidelines on implementing a basic unet. 
- Re-examined transfer learning strategy
  - the cyclical recog/interpolation strategy is irrelevant for this stage in the project. Implement a unet that can infer satellite imagery first, then apply an incremental training approach or a multi-stage inference approach to improve accuracy. Compute speed is relatively irrelevant compared to accuracy. 
  - implement a satellite inference model, then a ghg inference model. 
- how best to store/serialise models? 
- purchased google colab pro
