# Week 17 

# TODO 
- Meet with Allan and talk about strategies to catch up with where I need to be 
- Develop inference model 
  - Complete inference of one dataset - start with something easy and high-detail, like NO2 or SO2.
  - Sort file storage issues once and for all. If you have to pay for 2TB storage it's only Â£8/mo, and precaching necessary data would be far easier than 
- Create write-up draft skeleton 
  - Armature strategy - build an armature, then layer on muscles, skin, and expressivity. Fine-tune previous stage while working on the current stage. 
- Write all project criticisms into one document for import into the write-up
  - What benefits do unproven inferences provide? 
- Cancel Paperspace subscription. 

#### Monday
- Updated to use GeoTIFF because it has better compression and fewer steps in the import chain. I also don't have to import tensorflow, which is presumably very heavyweight, just to process some images into normal images.
- Realised transfer learning isn't likely to work - it's going to upscale the image to match satellite imagery, which isn't what we want

#### Tuesday
- Implemented GeoTIFF -> PNG conversion. 
  - google drive's slow CRUD is very frustrating. 
  - Earth engine's mismatched RGB bands is also frustrating
- Planned out tabular learner architecture
  - Build a basic inferral network that can take a 100px by 100px image as an input (1km square on a side) and the ghg data as outputs. Train this network as best you can, but accept it's not going to work perfectly. 
  - Use a layer of this network (defined by experimentation and research) as inputs for a tabular recommender which includes the other greenhouse gas data. 
    - could a few convolution masks do the trick? 
  - The first component of this double network can be used to infer ghg concentrations from a given picture, the second uses this as a generated component for further analysis and more detailed inference. 
  - Incidentally, tabular analysis also invites further comparison. What other factors can be used in this tabular analysis? NB as interesting as this is, **do not focus on this over getting the project complete.**
    - Land Prices
    - prevailing wind direction 
    - land use
    - population density
    - land height 
    - biodiversity 
- Refactored image pipeline for brevity
- imported ghg datasets as CSV
