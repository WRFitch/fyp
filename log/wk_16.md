# Week 16

## TODO
- Create satellite inferrer and use this as the transferee for the GHG interpolator. 
- Import low- and high-resolution images into learner using the earth engine IDE. Start small and build up, buy more space if you need it. 
- Organise a meeting with Allan next week. 
- Draft background study for write-up
- What benefits do an unproven inference provide? 

## DONE
- moved data ingress to Earth Engine's crappy web ide. It works now, but only just.
- Realised the satellite data is available in other places than just google earth engine and I didn't have to go through all this rubbish in the first place just because it's the first place I found it. Lesson learnt, I guess.
