# Week 13

- Planned project on kanban board 
- Found a fat stack of background research 
- Deep dive into Google Earth Engine so I can understand why the interface is so badly designed & how to work most effectively with it.
  - Christ, it's *so* badly designed.
  - Best practices documentation, but it's been designed for the javascript api -\_-
  - It turns out this is designed as a strange cloud client-server application, with the option to export chunks of data when you choose to. This is because the datasets can be petabyte-scale, such as one of the ones I'm using
-  Worked out a scaling/streaming data strategy to work around massive dataset
  - start by interpolating km2-scale data to 100m2/pix, removing irrelevant data such as large wastelands and oceans. 
  - Downsample data to 1% by taking 10% vertical and horizontal samples for testing - this takes dataset down to 28GB, which can be streamed in 10mb/100mb chunks if the usage limits are favourable. 
  - upscale to 10m2 when needed, for now.
