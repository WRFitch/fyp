Week 5 Log
- complete and submit project synopsis
- detail previous architectural choices 
  - originally a heatmap design was planned for the classifier, so I could use visual classifiers in a transfer learning plan. This required some overhead wrt preprocessing and storage, and wasn't guaranteed to work. However, I intend to use this as a visualisation at a later date
  - At time of writing, the plan is instead to edit the output layers of an existing satellite classifier, and use these as a set of input nodes along with the latitude, longitude and GHG data. 
- data sourcing continues to be an issue
- started a weekly project log
- creating a narrative structure for this project the way Allan suggested is challenging - does telling the story of this experiment really make for good science?
