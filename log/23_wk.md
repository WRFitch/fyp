# Week 23 Log 

Due date is 26 March, at 11am. 
Complete 1st draft by the end of this week. 

## Monday
- planned sections 4 & 5 of dissertation 

## Tuesday
- Dissertation 
  - Section 4 draft completed
  - Section 5 mostly drafted
- Minor cleanup to AI script
- Researched network slicing

## Wednesday
- Finished most of Section 5, structural draft for section 6
- fixed local data import pipeline & imported several hundred images. This is going to take a while. 
- Further research into network slicing - this is actually called "discriminative learning rates", in which you want lower level nodes to train slower, since they're already good at what they do, while higher-level nodes can update. Since I'm using the network for something unrelated, I need to trial and error my ideal learning rates. An implementation of lr.find for different types of lr gradient would be cool. 
- releasing a neural encoder might be as easy as create\_body(resnet, cut) - I hope this works.
