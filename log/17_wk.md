# Week 17 Log - First week back of term

### TODO
- Complete 100px image segmentation
- Build basic emissions predictor for one greenhouse gas
- Plan dissertation 
- Write half of first draft of dissertation

#### Monday
- Allan Mtg
  - Focus on results first, dissertation later
    - Maybe get the bare bones of the disso sorted so I have a better foundation for everything? 
  - Happy with progress, if I can get my model sorted by next week I'll be in an excellent position
- no image sharding on cloud API blocks 100px image export. 
- Completed 256px^2 image splitting, came up with a better strategy that requires subdividing these images to create a better option. 
- Once the resolution stretching is sorted, I'll be all good. It's one of the following problems:
  - I'm using a poor projection (can test this using distortions from different latitudes along the same longitude)
  - There's an issue with scaling somewhere in the image pipeline (this is the most likely, but I've already examined everything... more detail needed)
  - My eyes are just kinda terrible (the millenium dome is twice as wide as it is high - that can't be me!)
  - GeoTIFF export (no idea how it works)

##### Notes:
- It might be smart to export images in-memory and use as many bands from the images as possible in learning
  - no it wouldn't, this is going to be unbearably slow 

#### Tuesday
- Fixed map projection scaling issues. I'm never paying attention to map projections ever again.  

#### Wednesday
- Figured out a basic draft for my FYP presentation
- standardised projections 
- Cleared out old kanban cruft 
- designed and started to implement an integrated image export pipeline. It's very very stupid, but it gets done exactly what I want, in exactly the way I want it.
- Implemented a half-decent csv export architecture 
- Implemented the point-img export!  

##### Notes: 
- Earth engine has animated visualisation exports from ImageCollections. These can be used in my powerpoint to visualise greenhouse gas changes through the seasons.   

#### Thursday
- Implemented some basic batch file management methods so when I import large volumes of pictures I'm not stuck with masses of bad data
- Implemented basic rate limiter for image imports

#### Friday 
- Finished rate limiter 
- Imported and processed a ton of images for training 
- Automated CSV processing so lat and long can be easily accessed

#### Saturday
- Implemented a basic data labelling function
