# Week 24
3 weeks remaining. 

## TODO
- Finalise CNN model as far as possible
  - Complete testing on different resnet depths
  - Test discriminative learning rates
  - Isolate largest failures and use them as a second stage of training, with the test set being the rest of the network to ensure it generalises well. 
- Build basic tabular framework if possible.

## Monday
- Removed custom RMSE implementation because it's not worth the hassle. Average is fine, we can test them properly later. 
- Exported resnet101 implementation
- imported 3000 new images
- Tested variable learning rates
