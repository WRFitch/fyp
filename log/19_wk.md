# Week 19
## TODO
- Complete demonstration pipeline
- Get multivariate regression working
- Complete refactors
- Draft presentation
- Add background research 

## Monday
- Sprint goal-setting 
  - Trying out an agile plan with a friend
- Extracted commonalities from scripts, to begin refac cleanup 
- Migrated to paperspace because colab is hitting usage limits 
- removed unnecessary tutorials from git to make for more usable stats. 
- Received covid diagnosis, putting a limit on the amount I can work this week. 

## Tuesday
- Multiple regression functions at the datablock now works. 
- Researched multidimensional y\_range outputs. They don't exist in fastai, so we have to sort out a worse solution.
- Got multivariate regression working with rmse down to 0.585! No concrete results yet, but I should be able to see how things change with deeper networks. 
- Hit usage limits again. I need to be constantly using the GPU, or it'll trigger again, but I can't have any long-running scripts that abuse this.  

## Wednesday 
- Implemented draft test pipeline and copied over visualisation code from import script. Import code comes later.
- Started implementing a local import script so I don't run into colab usage limits. 
  - Optimising this can probably come after the demo script and associated refax are all sorted.
