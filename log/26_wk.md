  - Carefully described evaluation

## Tuesday
- Finished literature review 
- Finishing up Demo NB
- Report is now in a submissible state, with second drafts completed for every section but 7 and Appendix A.

## Wednesday
- Dissertation is almost complete.
  - Review implementation
  - Review evaluation
  - Rewrite reflections 
- Final code cleanup is complete. 
- Self-marking is complete, with either an A or a B depending on how you view my code. It's messy, but it's also kind of a development environment? that said, getting ghg concentrations simply by inputting "buckinham palace" is quite neat.
