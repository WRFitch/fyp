# Choices for this project, and why they were made 

| Language/Framework | Use | Reason | 
| Python | Majority of the project | lots of AI frameworks use it, it's a new language |
| fast.ai | Creating and Training AI models | It's easy to use and I already understand how it works. Training is free online. |
| PyTorch | Creating and Training AI models, interfacing with fast.ai where necessary | fast.ai is based on it and can be used to extend it, it's more beginner-friendly than tensorflow |
| Bash | Automating devenv | Easy to use on linux |
| Markdown | Docs & notes | It's easy to work with on git |
| Jupyter Notebooks | Python/data science programming environment | Easy to get to grips with, fast workflow, industry standard | 

## Other tools used
- Nvidia GTX970 - it was the only graphics card I had that was capable of using Nvidia CUDA. 
- Nvidia CUDA - AI-capable GPU framework. This has been an absolute bastard to install, so using cloud infrastructure would be very useful in future. 
- Kindle - used for reading papers and books on climate change.
